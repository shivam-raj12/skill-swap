# 🧠 Skill Swap — Learn. Teach. Grow.

> A collaborative platform built for the **Appwrite Hackathon**, enabling people to **exchange skills** with others around the world.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Skill Swap** is a community-driven platform where users can **learn new skills by teaching what they already know**.  
Instead of paying for lessons, users can offer their own expertise in return — creating a mutually beneficial learning ecosystem.

This project was created as part of the **Appwrite Hackathon**, leveraging **Appwrite’s backend services** to manage authentication, databases, storage, and real-time interactions seamlessly.

---

## 💡 Core Idea

- Everyone has something to **teach** and something to **learn**.
- Skill Swap connects users with **complementary interests** — for example, a designer wanting to learn coding can connect with a developer who wants to learn design.
